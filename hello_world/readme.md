## Writing and Running a Rust Program

Next, make a new source file and call it main.rs. Rust files always end with the .rs extension. If youâ€™re using more than one word in your filename, the convention is to use an underscore to separate them. For example, use hello_world.rs rather than helloworld.rs.

Now open the main.rs file you just created and enter the code in Listing 1-1.

Filename: main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Listing 1-1: A program that prints Hello, world!

Save the file and go back to your terminal window in the ~/projects/hello_world directory. On Linux or macOS, enter the following commands to compile and run the file:

```sh
rustc main.rs
./main
# Hello, world!
```
